# Med School Interview Questions
This is a single page web app to help with med school interview prep. These are the set of questions my friends got during their interviews and should give you an idea of what you might be asked. If there are any questions you think are missing feel free to report them as "issues" for now while we think through an easy way to collaborate on this project.

## Local Development
This was a quick 30 minute next.js project I put together with Claude + GitHub Copilot so I figured it'd be good to keep it public.

1. [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/) Node.js if you don't already have it on your machine. For additional reference, [this](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup) is the process to get started with next.js projects.
2. Clone the repo via HTTPS or SSH: `git clone https://github.com/aneeshsoni/med-school-interview-questions.git`
3. From the root of the project, run `npm install` to pull the project dependencies
4. Start the development server with the following command
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
