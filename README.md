# Med School Interview Questions
This is a single page web app to help with med school interview prep. These are the set of questions my friends got during their interviews and should give you an idea of what you might be asked. If there are any questions you think are missing feel free to report them as "bugs" (I know not the most scalable way to do this but hey it works for now).

## Local Development
This was a quick 30 minute next.js project I put together with Claude + GitHub Copilot so I figured it'd be good to keep it public.

1. Install Node.js if you don't already have it on your machine. For reference, [this](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup) is the process to get started with next.js projects.
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `npm install` to pull the project dependencies
4. Start the development server with the following command
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
